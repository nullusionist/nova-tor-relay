Nova Tor Relay is a minimal, opinionated Docker image for running a secure Tor relay node with simple configuration via environment variables and `docker-compose`.

Image: [nullusionist/nova-tor-relay](https://hub.docker.com/r/nullusionist/nova-tor-relay)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit as needed
3. Launch with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> üìå Make sure to forward ports `9001` (ORPort) and `9030` (DirPort) from your router/firewall to this host.  
> Future versions may optionally support automatic UPnP port forwarding.

Your relay will automatically:

- Detect its public IP
- Generate a persistent random nickname based on your chosen prefix
- Apply bandwidth limits
- Register with the Tor network

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All settings are configured via environment variables. See `.env.example` for all available options.

### Common overrides

```env
CONTACT=your@email.com
BANDWIDTH_LIMIT=100 KB
BANDWIDTH_BURST=200 KB
# NICKNAME=MyRelay
# EXIT_RELAY=1
# EXIT_POLICY=accept 80,443
# ACCOUNTING_START=day 1 00:00
# ACCOUNTING_MAX=5 GB
```

Multiline config (like `MyFamily` or logging) can be injected via:

```env
TOR_EXTRA_LINES=Log notice stdout\nMyFamily ABC123,DEF456
```

## üîÅ Automatic Updates

This repo includes a Watchtower config to auto-update your relay container when a new image is pushed.

```yaml
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exit Relay Notice

Running an **exit node** comes with legal and abuse implications. Exit mode is disabled by default. Only enable `EXIT_RELAY=1` if you know what you're doing.
